## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- `npm` (or your preferred package manager)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quzr.git
cd quzr
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following line:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/quzr_dev?schema=public"
    ```

4.  **Start the PostgreSQL database:**
    Make sure Docker is running, then execute:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    This command will set up the database schema.
    ```bash
    npm run db:migrate
    ```

6.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The backend API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration).
